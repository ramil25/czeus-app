# Mobile Image Upload Fix - Implementation Details

## Problem Solved
The mobile app was saving local "file://" URIs directly to the Supabase `products.image_url` field instead of uploading the images to the server first. This caused images to be inaccessible since local file URIs only exist on the user's device.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Mobile Upload Utility (`utils/imageUpload.ts`)
- `uploadImageFromMobile()`: Uploads local file URIs to the API endpoint
- `isLocalFileUri()`: Detects if a URI is a local file that needs uploading
- `isValidImageUri()`: Validates image file extensions

### 2. Updated AddProductModal
- Detects local file URIs using `isLocalFileUri()`
- Uploads images before creating products
- Shows uploading progress indicator
- Handles upload failures gracefully (creates product without image)
- Only saves server URLs to Supabase

### 3. Updated EditProductModal  
- Same upload logic as AddProductModal
- Preserves original image URL if new upload fails
- Prevents editing during upload process

## Technical Details

### Upload Process Flow
1. User selects image via expo-image-picker → gets local "file://" URI
2. Before saving to Supabase: Check if URI is local using `isLocalFileUri()`
3. If local: Upload to `https://czeus-app.vercel.app/api/upload-image`
4. Use returned server URL for `image_url` field
5. If upload fails: Show error and continue without image

### Error Handling
- Upload failures show user-friendly alerts
- Products can still be created/updated without images
- Loading states prevent multiple operations
- Original images preserved on edit failures

### Supported URI Types
- ✅ `file://` - Local filesystem (Android/iOS)
- ✅ `content://` - Android content provider  
- ✅ `assets-library://` - iOS photo library
- ✅ `https://` - Already uploaded URLs (no re-upload)

## Files Modified
- `mobile/czeus/utils/imageUpload.ts` (new)
- `mobile/czeus/components/modals/AddProductModal.tsx`
- `mobile/czeus/components/modals/EditProductModal.tsx`

## Testing Results
All scenarios tested successfully:
- Local file URIs → Upload to server ✅
- Existing URLs → Keep as-is ✅  
- Upload failures → Graceful handling ✅
- No more "file://" URIs in database ✅

## API Endpoint Used
- **URL**: `https://czeus-app.vercel.app/api/upload-image`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: FormData with `file` and `folder` fields
- **Response**: `{success: true, url: "...", filename: "..."}`

The fix ensures that only valid, accessible image URLs are saved to the Supabase database, resolving the mobile image upload issue completely.
