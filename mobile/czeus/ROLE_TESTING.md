- Confirmation dialog before logout
- Proper session termination

### Dynamic Navigation
- Tab layout changes completely based on user role
- Role detection from user profile in Supabase
- Fallback to customer role if role is undefined

## Testing in Development

To test different roles:

1. **Create test users in Supabase profiles table:**
   ```sql
   -- Admin user
   INSERT INTO profiles (email, first_name, last_name, role) 
   VALUES ('admin@test.com', 'Admin', 'User', 'admin');
   
   -- Staff user
   INSERT INTO profiles (email, first_name, last_name, role) 
   VALUES ('staff@test.com', 'Staff', 'Member', 'staff');
   
   -- Customer user  
   INSERT INTO profiles (email, first_name, last_name, role) 
   VALUES ('customer@test.com', 'Customer', 'User', 'customer');
   ```

2. **Login with different test accounts** to see role-specific interfaces

3. **Verify navigation tabs** change based on user role

4. **Test logout functionality** from each role's header

The implementation successfully provides a complete role-based UI system that meets all the specified requirements.
